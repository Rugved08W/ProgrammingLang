# ProgrammingLang
This is my programming language that I'm trying to make. Might work, might not.
I am making this for no reason at all, just bored w/studies.

My code will have 2 different modes, Be ; for beginners and Pro ; for long time coders, people who have done coding before and can do a lot of stuff.

I've yet to decide what other things I might do to it.
Example code (Be ;)

Be ;  
x = input("Enter a number:")  
loop x > 0 // show x % 2  
when x % 2 = 0 // show "Even"  
when x % 2 = 1 // show "Odd"

Example code (Pro ;)

Pro ;  
x = 5  
func_a == // while x > 0 // print x // x - 1  
y = "Liftoff!"  
/execute y : x

What's Next?  
I'll be adding separate files for:  
Rules - Detailing how the language works  
Commands - A reference for available functions and syntax  

Open to suggestions & contributions. Feel free to explore, experiment, and recommend improvements.
